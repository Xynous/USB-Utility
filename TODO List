TODO:

1. Gradually improve readability of the python modules by using methods and possibly reducing the comments in the python source files overtime.

2. Gradually rewrite the documentation on github and within the python source files. Overall, confirm source file comments and github documentation is correct. (Mention in the testing section that this was tested on older AMD hardware/Motherboards (Fx8370 CPU motherboards). This task will be done overtime.

3. Consider designing a simple GTK based (or equivalent) user interface (GUI) for the python modules functionality. This provides ease to use user interface compared to just terminal interaction. (Already documented on github)


Finished:
1. Fixed a few logic errors with the "grub_backup_deletion" python module. (Done)

2. Re write parts of the "grub-backup" python module and test to confirm its all working (Done)

3. Test "USB-3.0-Fix" python module to confirm its working and also rename python module to "USB-Fix". (Will test again, but confirm it was working before correctly as expected) - (Done)

4. Test and re write parts of the "grub-file-restore" python module (Done)

5. Final testing of the python modules before committing to github.(Done)
